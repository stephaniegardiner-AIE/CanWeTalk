3,6,24,5,Description,WifeName takes a deep breath before responding.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,6,24,6,Wife,I think it would be best for both of us if you started sleeping on the couch.,1,youAttitude,midLoss,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,6,24,7,You,Oh…,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,6,24,8,Wife,It's just been really awkward with us both in the same bed recently. I’m sure we’d both sleep better if we weren’t worrying about staying on our side of the bed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,6,25,0,Description,WifeName arrives home to find me chilling on the couch.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Action,PickingKidsUp,TRUE,Action,ForgotToPickKidsUp,TRUE
3,6,25,1,You,Hey! How was your day?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,6,25,2,Wife,Great* thanks for asking. Are the kids in their room?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,6,25,3,Description,The blood drains from my face.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3,6,25,6,Description,WifeName immediately runs out the door* returning twenty minutes later with two very angry looking children.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,6,25,7,You,Hey kids. How was your day?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,6,25,8,Description,They both ignore me* walking straight to their rooms. I can’t exactly blame them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,6,25,9,Wife,You’re sleeping on the couch tonight.,1,youAttitude,lowLoss,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,6,25,10,You,That doesn’t seem necessary.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,6,25,11,Wife,You know what? You’re right. What’s necessary is that you sleep on the couch every night from now on.,1,youAttitude,highLoss,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,6,25,12,You,I-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,6,25,13,Description,I try to respond but WifeName immediately leaves the room. Looks like I’ll be sleeping on the couch for the foreseeable future.,,,,,,,,,,SleepingOnCouch,,,,,,,,,,

4,7,26,3,You,Oh* okay. I can do that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,7,26,4,Description,I head into the kitchen to make a sandwich. I know better than to return to the table* instead choosing to eat my sandwich on the bed. A little while later* WifeName enters the room.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,7,26,5,Wife,I think you should sleep on the couch.,1,youAttitude,lowLoss,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,7,26,6,You,Look I’m sorry I couldn’t pick up the kids* but I really did have some work to catch up on.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,7,26,7,Wife,I understand. But if you’re not willing to make that sacrifice for the family then I think you should make another one. Sleeping on the couch is a great start.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,7,27,0,You,Um… okay* yeah. You’re right* us sleeping in the same bed isn’t working. I’ll move my stuff.,2,wifeAttitude,midGain,youAttitude,lowLoss,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,7,27,1,Wife,Thank you. I think this will help us both.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,7,27,2,You,Sure.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,7,27,3,Description,I quickly grab my pillow and make my way down to the couch. I’ve slept here before* but it feels significantly less comfortable than I remember.

4,7,28,0,You,That’s not happening.,2,wifeAttitude,midLoss,youAttitude,lowGain,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,7,28,1,Wife,Excuse me?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,7,28,2,You,You heard me. This is my bed* I’m not leaving it just because you want me to.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,7,28,3,Description,WifeName lets out something that sounds like a mix between a frustrated sigh and the shriek of a banshee before grabbing her pillow.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,7,28,4,Wife,Fine* but I’m not staying here with you. I’ll sleep on the couch.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,7,28,5,You,Whatever! Do what you want.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,7,28,6,Description,WifeName storms out of the room. I drop into bed* finally able to stretch out* and have the best sleep that I’ve had in a while.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,7,29,0,Description,Family breakfast is quiet as ever when I get a call on my phone. I look down to see none other than the name of my best friend* FriendName. I quickly excuse myself from the table and answer the call.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,7,29,1,Friend,PlayerName! How’re you doing you piece of garbage!,1,youAttitude,lowGain,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,7,29,2,You,FriendName! Worse now that I’m hearing your voice!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,7,29,3,Description,FriendName laughs* but his voice quickly drops.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,7,29,4,Friend,I heard about the… you know what. Are you doing okay?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4,7,31,7,You,Absolutely* no way that gets cancelled.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4,8,32,2,Friend,Okay then.,1,youAttitude,lowLoss,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,8,32,3,Description,I can tell in his voice that he doesn’t believe me* and honestly* neither do I. This has been really tough and I’m not sure how much longer I can take it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,8,32,4,You,I’ll talk to you later* okay? We’ve still got poker night on Friday.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,8,32,5,Friend,Yeah okay* cool. See you then.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4,8,33,0,You,Honestly* I’m not doing so well.,1,friendAttitude,lowGain,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,8,33,1,Friend,I’m sorry to hear that. What’s going on?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,8,33,2,Description,I spend the next couple of minutes explaining everything to FriendName. He’s a good listener* and I appreciate the fact that he’s here for me. By the end* I almost feel a little better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,8,33,3,Friend,That’s terrible. Is there anything I can do?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,8,33,4,You,Just make sure you come to poker night this Friday. I really need the distraction.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,8,33,5,Friend,You got it PlayerName. I hope you’re ready to lose all your money.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,8,33,6,You,That’s not quite how I remember last week going.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,8,33,7,Friend,You got lucky! That won’t happen again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,8,33,8,You,Whatever you say. See you Friday.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,8,33,9,Friend,Bye!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,8,33,10,Description,I hang up and take a breath. I’m glad I opened up to FriendName about all of this* I’m sure I’ll need his support in the future. For now* I just head back to the table and finish breakfast with the family.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,9,34,0,Description,WifeName sends the kids to bed early tonight* which I take as not a good sign.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,9,34,1,Wife,There’s something I need to talk to you about.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,9,34,2,Description,My mind is racing. What’s next? Surely she isn’t going to ask me to cancel poker night.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,9,34,3,Wife,I’ve contacted the court and we have a hearing set for tomorrow afternoon. It’s really important that you come so we can get started on the divorce proceedings.,1,youAttitude,lowGain,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,9,34,4,Description,That’s worse.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,9,34,5,You,Yeah* sure. I’ll be there.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,9,34,6,Description,WifeName nods.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,9,34,7,Wife,Good.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,9,34,8,You,So* what sort of stuff are we going to go over at this hearing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,9,34,9,Wife,Oh you know. The usual stuff. Division of assets* nullification of the marriage. Child custody.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,9,34,10,Description,She tries to slip the last one in casually but it doesn’t work.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,9,34,11,You,Child custody? Are you going to try to take the kids?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,9,34,12,Wife,What* no* of course not. It’s just something we need to discuss.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,9,35,0,You,Right* sorry. I shouldn’t have freaked out there* of course we’re going to share the kids.,2,wifeAttitude,lowGain,kidsAttitude,lowGain,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,9,35,1,Wife,Exactly. I’m glad you feel that way.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,9,35,2,You,Of course. These kids need both of their parents in their life. Fighting each other for them will only make things worse.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,9,35,3,Description,WifeName gives me a hug* evidently relieved that the conversation didn’t turn into a huge fight.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,9,35,4,Wife,I’m so happy that we’re on the same page about this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,9,35,5,You,Yeah* me too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,9,35,6,Description,With that* the two of us head off to our respective sleeping arrangements. I’m not looking forward to the hearing tomorrow* but it seems like at least we’ll be in agreement of at least one thing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,10,36,0,You,Actually… I think you should.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,10,36,1,Wife,What?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,10,36,2,You,Well* initially it seemed weird* but after thinking about it for a second* I think you should. You’re way better with the kids than I am* and honestly* I’m not sure how much I can provide for them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,10,36,3,Wife,Are you sure?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,10,36,4,You,I think so. All that movement* half a week here and half a week there* that’s no life for a kid. When all this is done* I think they should live with you.,2,wifeAttitude,highGain,kidsAttitude,highLoss,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,10,36,5,Wife,If that’s what you want* then okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,10,36,6,Description,I nod. The kids aren’t going to like this* I’m sure to them it’ll seem like I’m abandoning them. Tomorrow’s hearing is going to be hard* but in the end it’s for the best.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,10,37,0,You,I don’t think so. Those kids are my life* and once all this is done* they’re living with me.,2,wifeAttitude,highLoss,kidsAttitude,highLoss,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,10,37,1,Wife,PlayerName* there’s no need to do this. We can share custody. The kids need us both in their lives.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,10,37,2,You,You’re welcome to fight* but I’m filing for sole custody. See you in court.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,10,37,3,Description,With that I walk out of the room and get ready to sleep. At least with our new sleeping arrangements* I no longer have to worry about seeing her for the rest of the night.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,11,38,0,Description,I enter the courtroom to find WifeName waiting there* alongside a judge* and one of the most stunning people I’ve ever seen. The vision of perfection steps towards me and holds out a hand.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,11,38,2,Lawyer,Hi* I’m HotDivorceLawyerName. I’ve been appointed by the court to help everything get sorted out smoothly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5,11,39,1,Description,HotDivorceLawyerName laughs* but WifeName doesn’t seem very impressed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,11,39,2,Lawyer,I appreciate the invitation* but I don’t think that would be very appropriate considering the situation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5,11,41,1,Lawyer,On to the next point of order. Custody.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,11,41,2,Wife,WifeName and I look at it each. This is it. Whatever choice I make here will massively affect how the rest of this divorce goes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5,11,42,2,Lawyer,Legally* there’s nothing stopping PlayerName from filing for full custody.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,11,42,3,You,What’s best for our children is for them to live with me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,11,42,4,Wife,Well then I’m filing for full custody too!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,11,42,5,Description,HotDivorceLawyerName immediately starts writing up the paperwork. I can’t help but admire their efficiency.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,11,42,6,Lawyer,Then it is settled. At the next hearing* both parties should prepare arguments of why they believe the other parent is unfit for custody of the children.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,11,42,7,Description,WifeName and I exchange glares as we leave the courtroom.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,11,42,8,Wife,I can’t believe you did that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,11,42,9,You,I’m just doing what I believe would be best for the kids. I won’t apologise for that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,11,42,10,Wife,Well it’s in motion now. We just need to make sure not to fight infront of the kids.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,11,42,11,You,Agreed. Let’s do our best to remain civil.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,11,42,12,Description,The two of us nod* before heading off on our separate ways.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5,12,43,2,Wife,Thank you* PlayerName.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,12,43,3,Lawyer,Both parties are in agreement. At the next hearing* arrangements for visitation can be finalised.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,12,43,4,Description,As we leave the court room* WifeName speaks to me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,12,43,5,Wife,That was really mature of you. I promise I will be very reasonable when we discuss visitation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,12,43,6,You,Thanks. It was the right call to make.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,12,43,7,Description,The two of us say our goodbyes and set off as night starts to fall.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5,12,45,4,Wife,I’m really glad that we’re on the same page. I was so worried that this would turn into a massive fight.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,12,45,5,You,The happiness of our children is much more important than any petty fights we could have.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,12,45,6,Description,We chat for a couple more minutes before both heading out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,12,46,0,Wife,Actually* I want to file for full custody. I don’t believe PlayerName is a fit parent.,1,youAttitude,highLoss,,,,,,,(If Wife Attitude < 20)* MC Happiness Down (Big),,,,,,,,,,
5,12,46,1,You,Excuse me? Then I’m filing for full custody too!,,,,,,,,,,Gain ‘Wants Full Custody’,,,,,,,,,,
5,12,46,2,Lawyer,If that is the case* then both parties should prepare arguments for why they believe the other is an unfit parent for these children. They can be heard at the next hearing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,12,46,3,Description,The rest of the court session is spent in silence as HotDivorceLawyerName fills out the paperwork. As we leave the court I go over to WifeName.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,12,46,4,You,What’s wrong with you?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,12,46,5,Wife,We both know you’re not fit to be a parent. I’m just looking out for our children.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,12,46,6,Description,There’s no point talking to her. I’ll just have to prove that I’m not an unfit parent. The two of us head off in separate directions without saying goodbye.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,13,47,0,Description,WifeName and the kids are already out of the house when I get up for breakfast. DogName sits by the table* perking up when I walk into the room.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

6,14,50,15,Description,Finally* I get a couple of good cards. Play goes around the table until it’s just me and FriendName. FriendName pushes his entire stack into the middle of the table.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,14,50,16,Friend,I’m all-in. Can you handle the heat?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,14,50,17,Description,I stare deep into his sunglassed eyes. I’m looking for anything* a twitch* a wince* a cough* but he’s completely still. I can’t read him.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

6,14,51,9,You,It’s all good FriendName. I’m fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,14,51,10,Description,We start play back up but there’s a lull in the room. No one’s making eye contact and everyone’s only speaking two words at a time. I find myself almost wishing WifeName would get home* just to break up the silence. Unfortunately* that’s what happens about ten minutes later.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

11,25,96,3,,KidBoyName probably shouldn’t have said those things but you can’t hit people. That’s not how we express ourselves in this family.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

11,25,97,1,,The kids look down at their feet* and silently follow me back to the car. I feel terrible seeing them like this* but I know it’s the right thing to do. We drive home in silence* neither of them saying a word the entire trip.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

12,27,101,2,,That is correct.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,101,3,,Well then* in order to properly decide who should have full custody of the child* both sides must present arguments to demonstrate why the other is an unfit guardian.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,101,4,,My brain quickly runs through the past few weeks* trying to wonder what WifeName will say to make me look like an unfit guardian.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
