0,1,3,You,What are we going to do about the kids?,,,,,,,,,,
0,1,4,Wife,We can discuss that later. All that matters now is that we’re on the same page.,,,,,,,,,,
0,1,5,You,We should at least tell them. They deserve to know that things are going to change.,,,,,,,,,,
0,1,6,Wife,You’re right. Would you be able to tell them? I don’t think I have the strength to look them in the eyes right now.,,,,,,,,,,

0,4,1,Wife,You think this isn’t hard on me too? I had no other choice* it wasn’t working!,,,,,,,,,,
0,4,2,Description,I turn away* unable to look at her any more. I turn the TV up more and more* drowning out any words she tries to say to me. After a few more attempts* her face falls* and she walks out of the room.,,,,,,,,,,

0,6,2,Description,His voice wakes up KidGirlName. Her eyes look like they’re peering into my soul.,,,,,,,,,,
0,6,3,Girl,Is everything okay?,,,,,,,,,,
0,6,4,You,Uhhh… um…,,,,,,,,,,
0,6,5,Description,My brain has frozen. How can I possibly tell these two amazing children that their entire life is about to change?,,,,,,,,,,
0,6,6,You,Well* you see* your mother and I are getting a divorce.,,,,,,,,,,
0,6,7,Boy,What? Why?,,,,,,,,,,
0,6,8,Girl,Is it something we did?,,,,,,,,,,
0,7,0,Description,The two of us enter the kids’ room. They’re both fast asleep. They look so peaceful.,,,,,,,,,,

0,7,12,Description,WifeName goes over to KidGirlName and envelops her in a huge hug.,,,,,,,,,,
0,7,13,Wife,Mum and Dad’s problems have absolutely nothing to do with you two. You are the best things that ever happened to us.,,,,,,,,,,

0,7,15,Description,After a few more questions* we put the kids back to bed and leave the room.,,,,,,,,,,
0,7,16,Wife,Thank you for doing this with me. I know it must be really hard.,,,,,,,,,,
0,7,17,You,All that matters is that the kids are okay through all of this.,,,,,,,,,,
0,7,18,Wife,You’re right. We can discuss the other stuff later.,,,,,,,,,,
0,7,19,Description,The two of us head to bed. It feels weird* sleeping there beside someone who just asked for a divorce* but at least it’s better than sleeping on the couch. I finally manage to drift off* dreading the day that I’m about to wake up to.,,,,,,,,,,
0,8,0,You,Your mother has decided she doesn’t love us anymore. She’s leaving us all.,2,wifeAttitude,-10,youAttitude,10,,,,,

0,8,3,You,I don’t know kids* I just don’t know.,,,,,,,,,,
0,8,4,Description,It feels good to put the blame on her* after all it pretty much is all her fault anyway. I know that* eventually* she’s going to find out about this* but for now* I feel a little better.,,,,,,,,,,
0,8,5,Description,After a few more minutes of venting with the kids* I tuck them back into bed and head back to my bedroom.,,,,,,,,,,
0,8,6,Wife,How’d it go?,,,,,,,,,,
0,8,7,You,Yeah* really good. I think they’re going to be okay.,,,,,,,,,,
0,8,8,Wife,That’s great.,,,,,,,,,,

0,8,10,Wife,You can tell me more about it in the morning. For now* I really need to get to sleep.,,,,,,,,,,
0,8,11,You,Me too.,,,,,,,,,,
0,8,12,Description,The two of us fall asleep* making sure to keep to our sides of the bed. I can barely sleep* eventually dropping into unconsciousness hours later.,,,,,,,,,,
0,9,0,Description,Looking down at KidGirlName’s face* her eyes filling with tears* I instantly crumble.,,,,,,,,,,
0,9,1,You,No* no* honey it’s not your fault at all. It’s my fault.,2,kidsAttitude,-10,youAttitude,-20,,,,,
0,9,2,Description,The kids’ faces immediately change.,,,,,,,,,,
0,9,3,Boy,What did you do?,,,,,,,,,,
0,9,4,You,Well when I say my fault* I don’t mean totally my fault.,,,,,,,,,,
0,9,5,Description,It's too late. I can see it in their eyes* I’ve made myself the bad guy.,,,,,,,,,,
0,9,6,Boy,Did you hurt her?,,,,,,,,,,
0,9,7,You,No! No* I mean* emotionally maybe?,,,,,,,,,,
0,9,8,Description,Every word that comes out of my mouth seems to be the wrong one. No matter how hard I try* I just keep making things worse. Eventually* I decide to cut my losses.,,,,,,,,,,
0,9,9,You,We can talk more in the morning. You guys need to get some sleep* you’ve got school tomorrow.,,,,,,,,,,
0,9,10,Boy,Whatever.,,,,,,,,,,
0,9,11,Description,The kids refuse to give me a hug goodnight* and I head to the bedroom* totally defeated.,,,,,,,,,,
0,9,12,Wife,How’d it go?,,,,,,,,,,
0,9,13,Description,I ignore WifeName completely* climbing into bed fully clothed and pretending to fall asleep. I spend the entire night coming up with ways to try to win the kids back* eventually falling asleep to dreams of a week-long Christmas and fortnightly trips to Disneyland.,,,,,,,,,,
0,10,0,You,… Yep. You guys did it.,2,kidsAttitude,-10,youAttitude,-5,,,,,
0,10,1,Description,I’m not sure why I said that* but I’ve got to stick with it now.,,,,,,,,,,
0,10,2,You,Yeah* uh* we just couldn’t handle having such terrible kids. It put so much pressure on our marriage that eventually we had to have a divorce.,,,,,,,,,,
0,10,3,Description,KidBoyName seems frozen in shock* while KidGirlName starts bawling her eyes out. You don’t always know when you’ve screwed up as a parent* but boy* this is a big one.,,,,,,,,,,
0,10,4,You,There there… don’t cry. Please.,,,,,,,,,,
0,10,5,Boy,Are we going to get put up for adoption?,,,,,,,,,,
0,10,6,You,No* don’t be silly. Your mother and I will just take turns looking after you guys so we can get some rest.,,,,,,,,,,
0,10,7,Description,KidGirlName starts crying even harder. I need to get out of here before I make things any worse.,,,,,,,,,,
0,10,8,You,So… yep. Great chat. See you guys tomorrow.,,,,,,,,,,
0,10,9,Description,I practically sprint out of the room* racing back to my bedroom.,,,,,,,,,,
0,10,10,Wife,How’d it go?,,,,,,,,,,
0,10,11,You,Uh* yep* good. The kids are a little upset of course but I’m sure they’ll be better in the morning. Anyway I really have to get to bed so I’ll talk more tomorrow. Night.,,,,,,,,,,
0,10,12,Description,I flip over and quickly pretend to fall asleep. I spend the entire night dreading seeing the kids tomorrow. They are most definitely not attending my funeral when I die.,,,,,,,,,,
0,11,0,You,No* it’s not your fault* it’s not anyone’s fault.,1,kidsAttitude,10,,,,,,,
0,11,1,Girl,Then why are you guys getting a divorce?,,,,,,,,,,
0,11,2,You,Sometimes* people just grow apart. Even if no one does anything wrong.,,,,,,,,,,
0,11,3,Boy,Are you going to grow apart from us?,,,,,,,,,,
0,11,4,You,Of course not.,,,,,,,,,,
0,11,5,Description,I give KidBoyName a hug and ruffle his hair.,,,,,,,,,,
