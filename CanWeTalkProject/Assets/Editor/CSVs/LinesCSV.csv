1,0,1,4,Wife,We can discuss that later. All that matters now is that we’re on the same page.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,0,1,5,You,We should at least tell them. They deserve to know that things are going to change.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,0,1,6,Wife,You’re right. Would you be able to tell them? I don’t think I have the strength to look them in the eyes right now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1,1,7,19,Description,The two of us head to bed. It feels weird* sleeping there beside someone who just asked for a divorce* but at least it’s better than sleeping on the couch. I finally manage to drift off* dreading the day that I’m about to wake up to.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1,1,8,5,Description,After a few more minutes of venting with the kids* I tuck them back into bed and head back to my bedroom.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1,1,9,7,You,No! No* I mean* emotionally maybe?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,1,9,8,Description,Every word that comes out of my mouth seems to be the wrong one. No matter how hard I try* I just keep making things worse. Eventually* I decide to cut my losses.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3,6,24,5,Description,WifeName takes a deep breath before responding.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3,6,24,7,You,Oh…,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,6,24,8,Wife,It's just been really awkward with us both in the same bed recently. I’m sure we’d both sleep better if we weren’t worrying about staying on our side of the bed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3,6,25,10,You,That doesn’t seem necessary.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,6,25,11,Wife,You know what? You’re right. What’s necessary is that you sleep on the couch every night from now on.,1,youAttitude,highLoss,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,6,25,12,You,I-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,6,25,13,Description,I try to respond but WifeName immediately leaves the room. Looks like I’ll be sleeping on the couch for the foreseeable future.,,,,,,,,,,,,SleepingOnCouch,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4,7,26,3,You,Oh* okay. I can do that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,7,26,4,Description,I head into the kitchen to make a sandwich. I know better than to return to the table* instead choosing to eat my sandwich on the bed. A little while later* WifeName enters the room.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,7,26,5,Wife,I think you should sleep on the couch.,1,youAttitude,lowLoss,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,7,26,6,You,Look I’m sorry I couldn’t pick up the kids* but I really did have some work to catch up on.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,7,26,7,Wife,I understand. But if you’re not willing to make that sacrifice for the family then I think you should make another one. Sleeping on the couch is a great start.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,7,27,0,You,Um… okay* yeah. You’re right* us sleeping in the same bed isn’t working. I’ll move my stuff.,2,wifeAttitude,midGain,youAttitude,lowLoss,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4,7,27,2,You,Sure.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,7,27,3,Description,I quickly grab my pillow and make my way down to the couch. I’ve slept here before* but it feels significantly less comfortable than I remember.

4,7,28,3,Description,WifeName lets out something that sounds like a mix between a frustrated sigh and the shriek of a banshee before grabbing her pillow.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,7,28,4,Wife,Fine* but I’m not staying here with you. I’ll sleep on the couch.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,7,28,5,You,Whatever! Do what you want.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4,8,32,3,Description,I can tell in his voice that he doesn’t believe me* and honestly* neither do I. This has been really tough and I’m not sure how much longer I can take it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4,8,32,5,Friend,Yeah okay* cool. See you then.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4,8,33,1,Friend,I’m sorry to hear that. What’s going on?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,8,33,2,Description,I spend the next couple of minutes explaining everything to FriendName. He’s a good listener* and I appreciate the fact that he’s here for me. By the end* I almost feel a little better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,8,33,3,Friend,That’s terrible. Is there anything I can do?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,8,33,4,You,Just make sure you come to poker night this Friday. I really need the distraction.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,8,33,5,Friend,You got it PlayerName. I hope you’re ready to lose all your money.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,8,33,6,You,That’s not quite how I remember last week going.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,8,33,7,Friend,You got lucky! That won’t happen again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,8,33,8,You,Whatever you say. See you Friday.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,8,33,9,Friend,Bye!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,8,33,10,Description,I hang up and take a breath. I’m glad I opened up to FriendName about all of this* I’m sure I’ll need his support in the future. For now* I just head back to the table and finish breakfast with the family.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,9,34,0,Description,WifeName sends the kids to bed early tonight* which I take as not a good sign.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,9,34,1,Wife,There’s something I need to talk to you about.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,9,34,2,Description,My mind is racing. What’s next? Surely she isn’t going to ask me to cancel poker night.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,9,34,3,Wife,I’ve contacted the court and we have a hearing set for tomorrow afternoon. It’s really important that you come so we can get started on the divorce proceedings.,1,youAttitude,lowGain,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,9,34,4,Description,That’s worse.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,9,34,5,You,Yeah* sure. I’ll be there.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,9,34,6,Description,WifeName nods.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,9,34,7,Wife,Good.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,9,34,8,You,So* what sort of stuff are we going to go over at this hearing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,9,34,9,Wife,Oh you know. The usual stuff. Division of assets* nullification of the marriage. Child custody.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,9,34,10,Description,She tries to slip the last one in casually but it doesn’t work.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,9,34,11,You,Child custody? Are you going to try to take the kids?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,9,34,12,Wife,What* no* of course not. It’s just something we need to discuss.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,9,35,0,You,Right* sorry. I shouldn’t have freaked out there* of course we’re going to share the kids.,2,wifeAttitude,lowGain,kidsAttitude,lowGain,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,9,35,1,Wife,Exactly. I’m glad you feel that way.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,9,35,2,You,Of course. These kids need both of their parents in their life. Fighting each other for them will only make things worse.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,9,35,3,Description,WifeName gives me a hug* evidently relieved that the conversation didn’t turn into a huge fight.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,9,35,4,Wife,I’m so happy that we’re on the same page about this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,9,35,5,You,Yeah* me too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,9,35,6,Description,With that* the two of us head off to our respective sleeping arrangements. I’m not looking forward to the hearing tomorrow* but it seems like at least we’ll be in agreement of at least one thing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,10,36,0,You,Actually… I think you should.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,10,36,1,Wife,What?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,10,36,2,You,Well* initially it seemed weird* but after thinking about it for a second* I think you should. You’re way better with the kids than I am* and honestly* I’m not sure how much I can provide for them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,10,36,3,Wife,Are you sure?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,10,36,4,You,I think so. All that movement* half a week here and half a week there* that’s no life for a kid. When all this is done* I think they should live with you.,2,wifeAttitude,highGain,kidsAttitude,highLoss,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,10,36,5,Wife,If that’s what you want* then okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,10,36,6,Description,I nod. The kids aren’t going to like this* I’m sure to them it’ll seem like I’m abandoning them. Tomorrow’s hearing is going to be hard* but in the end it’s for the best.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,10,37,0,You,I don’t think so. Those kids are my life* and once all this is done* they’re living with me.,2,wifeAttitude,highLoss,kidsAttitude,highLoss,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,10,37,1,Wife,PlayerName* there’s no need to do this. We can share custody. The kids need us both in their lives.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,10,37,2,You,You’re welcome to fight* but I’m filing for sole custody. See you in court.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,10,37,3,Description,With that I walk out of the room and get ready to sleep. At least with our new sleeping arrangements* I no longer have to worry about seeing her for the rest of the night.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,11,38,0,Description,I enter the courtroom to find WifeName waiting there* alongside a judge* and one of the most stunning people I’ve ever seen. The vision of perfection steps towards me and holds out a hand.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,11,38,2,Lawyer,Hi* I’m HotDivorceLawyerName. I’ve been appointed by the court to help everything get sorted out smoothly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5,11,41,1,Lawyer,On to the next point of order. Custody.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,11,41,2,Wife,WifeName and I look at it each. This is it. Whatever choice I make here will massively affect how the rest of this divorce goes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5,11,42,3,You,What’s best for our children is for them to live with me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,11,42,4,Wife,Well then I’m filing for full custody too!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,11,42,5,Description,HotDivorceLawyerName immediately starts writing up the paperwork. I can’t help but admire their efficiency.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,11,42,6,Lawyer,Then it is settled. At the next hearing* both parties should prepare arguments of why they believe the other parent is unfit for custody of the children.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,11,42,7,Description,WifeName and I exchange glares as we leave the courtroom.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,11,42,8,Wife,I can’t believe you did that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,11,42,9,You,I’m just doing what I believe would be best for the kids. I won’t apologise for that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,11,42,10,Wife,Well it’s in motion now. We just need to make sure not to fight infront of the kids.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,11,42,11,You,Agreed. Let’s do our best to remain civil.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,11,42,12,Description,The two of us nod* before heading off on our separate ways.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5,12,43,1,Description,HotDivorceLawyerName starts filling out paperwork. I could be imagining it but I think they look kind of disappointed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,12,43,2,Wife,Thank you* PlayerName.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,12,43,3,Lawyer,Both parties are in agreement. At the next hearing* arrangements for visitation can be finalised.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,12,43,4,Description,As we leave the court room* WifeName speaks to me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,12,43,5,Wife,That was really mature of you. I promise I will be very reasonable when we discuss visitation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5,12,43,7,Description,The two of us say our goodbyes and set off as night starts to fall.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5,12,45,3,Description,The paperwork is quickly written up and WifeName and I leave the court together.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,12,45,4,Wife,I’m really glad that we’re on the same page. I was so worried that this would turn into a massive fight.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,12,45,5,You,The happiness of our children is much more important than any petty fights we could have.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,12,45,6,Description,We chat for a couple more minutes before both heading out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5,12,46,3,Description,The rest of the court session is spent in silence as HotDivorceLawyerName fills out the paperwork. As we leave the court I go over to WifeName.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,12,46,4,You,What’s wrong with you?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,12,46,5,Wife,We both know you’re not fit to be a parent. I’m just looking out for our children.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,12,46,6,Description,There’s no point talking to her. I’ll just have to prove that I’m not an unfit parent. The two of us head off in separate directions without saying goodbye.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

10,24,92,4,Description,The rest of the night is spent with the two of us professionally asking and answering questions* remaining on topic and focused.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

10,24,92,6,You,Of course. If there’s ever anything else I can do to help this process along please don’t hesitate to let me know.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,24,92,7,Lawyer,I might just hold you to that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,24,92,8,Description,We head off our separate ways. I’m still a bit confused about where I stand with HotDivorceLawyerName but I think there could be something there. I quickly fall asleep* brainstorming different lines to use in the future.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,24,93,0,Description,The breakfast table is calm* no chants for pancakes or visits from friends. The kids are leaving for school when WifeName turns to me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,24,93,1,Wife,Oh I’ve been meaning to ask* would you be able to cook dinner tonight? I’ll be getting home from work late and I’m not sure I’ll have the time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,24,93,2,You,Yeah I should probably be able to do that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,24,93,3,Wife,Great* thank you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

11,25,94,3,You,Yeah* I’m their dad.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,25,94,4,Principal,Well sir* I regret to inform you that your children got in a fight today. We’re going to need you to come down to pick them up.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,25,94,5,You,Sure* I’ll be right there.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,25,94,6,Description,I quickly make my way down to the school to pick them up. As soon as they see me arrive they run over to me* both speaking at a rapid pace.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,25,94,7,Boy,Dad it wasn’t my fault* it was all KidGirlName-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,25,94,8,Girl,KidBoyName started it* I wasn’t doing anything wrong-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,25,94,9,You,Okay okay* it’s all okay. You’re not in trouble* just tell me what happened.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,25,94,10,Boy,I was talking to KidGirlName and being completely normal-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,25,94,11,Girl,He was really mean and he said that everything was my fault-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,25,94,12,Boy,And then she just hit me out of nowhere-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,25,94,13,Girl,And he kept yelling at me and saying he wished I was never born-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,25,94,14,Boy,And she gave me a huge bruise on my arm* see-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,25,94,15,Girl,He totally pretended that it hurt way more than it did-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,25,94,16,Description,I let them tire themselves out before responding.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,25,94,17,You,Okay I think I understand. KidBoyName was saying some mean things about KIdGirlName* and she got mad and hit him. Is that correct?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,25,94,18,Description,They both nod sheepishly.,,,,,,,,,,,What should I say?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,25,95,0,You,KidBoyName* you know that insulting and provoking your sister isn’t allowed. You’re in big trouble.,2,kidsAttitude,highLoss,youAttitude,midLoss,,,,,,[KidBoyName is in trouble,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,25,95,1,Boy,What!? What about her?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,25,95,2,You,You’re the older one* you should know better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,25,95,3,Girl,Thanks Dad!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,25,95,4,You,Come on guys* let’s go home. I don’t want to hear about anything like this happening again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,25,95,5,Description,KidBoyName refuses to speak to me the entire way home. At least I have KidGirlName to chat to until he changes his mind.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,25,96,0,You,KidGirlName* you know that you’re not allowed to hit people* even if they’re being mean. You’re in big trouble.,2,kidsAttitude,highLoss,youAttitude,midLoss,,,,,,[KidGirlName is in trouble,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,25,96,1,Boy,Yeah!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,25,96,2,Girl,How is that fair?!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,25,96,3,You,KidBoyName probably shouldn’t have said those things but you can’t hit people. That’s not how we express ourselves in this family.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,25,96,4,Girl,That’s so dumb! He should at least be in a little trouble!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,25,96,5,You,KidBoyName can get off with a warning this time as long as he promises never to say those things again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,25,96,6,Boy,Promise!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,25,96,7,Description,KidBoyName has a huge grin on his face as I herd the kids into the car. KidGirlName sits in silence and refuses to look at anyone the entire way home.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

11,25,97,1,Description,The kids look down at their feet* and silently follow me back to the car. I feel terrible seeing them like this* but I know it’s the right thing to do. We drive home in silence* neither of them saying a word the entire trip.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,25,98,0,You,It’s okay guys. This is a stressful time for all of us. You guys aren’t in trouble.,2,wifeAttitude,lowLoss,kidsAttitude,lowGain,,,,,,[Neither of you are in trouble,DidntDisciplineKids,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,25,98,1,Boy,Really?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,25,98,2,Girl,Are you sure?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,25,98,3,You,Absolutely. Just promise me it won’t happen again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,25,98,4,Boy,You got it Dad!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,25,98,5,Girl,I promise!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,25,98,6,Description,The kids jump into the car with a spring in their step* all thoughts of fighting gone from their minds. It might not be the most effective way to teach them about conflict resolution* but it’s definitely a lot more fun.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,26,99,0,Description,WifeName wanted me to make dinner tonight. She’ll be super annoyed if I decide to do something else.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Action,MakeDinner,TRUE,,,,,,,,,
12,27,100,0,Description,I arrive at the court feeling woefully unprepared for the day ahead. As I walk into the room* I see WifeName and HotDivorceLawyerName already there. I sit down at the table and take a deep breath* waiting for one of them to speak.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,100,1,Lawyer,Are we ready to start?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,100,2,Wife,I think so.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,100,3,You,Yeah* sure.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,101,0,Lawyer,Both of you wish to file for full custody* is that correct?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Action,WantsFullCustody,TRUE,,,,,,,,,
12,27,101,1,Description,WifeName shoots me a quick look before turning back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,101,2,Wife,That is correct.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,101,3,Lawyer,Well then* in order to properly decide who should have full custody of the child* both sides must present arguments to demonstrate why the other is an unfit guardian.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,101,4,Description,My brain quickly runs through the past few weeks* trying to wonder what WifeName will say to make me look like an unfit guardian.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,101,5,Lawyer,WifeName* would you like to go first?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,101,6,Wife,Sure.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,101,7,Description,WifeName nervously clears her throat before speaking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,102,0,Wife,PlayerName is an unfit parent who consistently chooses the easiest option over doing what is right for his kids. I have detailed a few of these moments in the following documents.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Action,ForgotToPickKidsUp,TRUE,Action,LetKidsStayUp,TRUE,Action,Didn’tDisciplineKids,TRUE,Action,GaveKidsPancakes,TRUE
12,27,102,1,Description,WifeName slides a folder over to HotDivorceLawyerName.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,102,2,Wife,There are a number of examples in there* but I want to talk about the one that I think was the worst.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,103,0,Wife,Just a little over a week ago* PlayerName was asked if he could pick up the kids from school. After agreeing to do so* PlayerName proceeded to forget about them and do something completely different.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Action,ForgotToPickKidsUp,TRUE,,,,,,,,,
12,27,103,1,You,Come on* it wasn’t like that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,103,2,Wife,I didn’t even find out about it until that night when I returned home* after which I immediately had to go pick them up myself.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,103,3,Lawyer,Is this true?,2,lawyerAttitude,megaLoss,youAttitude,midLoss,,,,,,What should I do?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,104,0,Wife,Just this Sunday* I asked PlayerName to put the kids to bed on time. I made it clear to him that if he didn’t* they wouldn’t want to go to school the next day.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Action,LetKidsStayUp,TRUE,,,,,,,,,
12,27,104,1,Description,I let out a sigh. Guess she’s still mad about that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,104,2,Wife,PlayerName did not send the kids to bed on time* and the next morning* they were overtired and argumentative about going to school.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,104,3,You,Well they still went.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,104,4,Wife,This action shows a clear neglect for the kids’ wellbeing* as well as an unwillingness to make the difficult decisions or say no.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,104,5,Description,HotDivorceLawyerName looks over at me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,104,6,Lawyer,Are these allegations true?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,105,0,Wife,Just yesterday* the kids got in a fight at school. Rather than properly handling the situation and letting them know that it’s not okay to act like that* he did what he always does and took the easy way out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Action,Didn’tDisciplineKids,TRUE,,,,,,,,,
12,27,105,1,You,Comforting my children isn’t ‘taking the easy way out’.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,105,2,Lawyer,We can discuss the exact implications of the situation later* what I need to know now is whether or not this recount of events is true.,,,,,,,,,,,What should I do?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,106,0,Wife,A couple of days ago* the kids wanted pancakes for breakfast. I specifically told them no* because it would make them late for school* but then PlayerName let them have some anyway!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Action,GaveKidsPancakes,TRUE,,,,,,,,,
12,27,106,1,You,…,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,106,2,Description,I let out a small laugh.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,106,3,You,That’s it? I gave the kids pancakes?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,106,4,Lawyer,Whether or not that proves that PlayerName is an unfit parent can be discussed later* for now* I just need to know whether the allegation is true.,,,,,,,,,,,What should I do?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,107,0,Wife,Um… I don’t have any examples currently.,2,lawyerAttitude,midGain,youAttitude,midGain,,,,,,,,,,,,Action,GaveKidsPancakes,FALSE,,,,,,,,,
12,27,107,1,Lawyer,If you can’t provide any evidence of PlayerName being an unfit parent then we can move on.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,107,2,Description,HotDivorceLawyerName looks over at me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,107,3,Lawyer,PlayerName* do you have any arguments prepared as to why WifeName should be considered an unfit parent.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,107,4,Description,I rack my brain but honestly can’t think of anything. We may not always be on the same page but she undoubtedly loves the kids.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,108,0,You,Yeah* technically I guess that’s something that happened.,2,wifeAttitude,midGain,lawyerAttitude,midLoss,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,108,1,Lawyer,Alright.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,108,2,Description,She looks disappointed* as if she was expecting WifeName to not be able to come up with anything.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,108,3,Lawyer,WifeName’s concerns will be recorded and looked over by a judge.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,108,4,You,This is ridiculous* I’m not an unfit parent!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,108,5,Lawyer,That’s not for me to decide. Now* PlayerName* you also have an opportunity to speak. Are you aware of any examples of WifeName being an unfit parent.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,108,6,Description,I already know that there’s nothing. WifeName is a great mum and I can’t think of any example I could use to make it look like that’s not the truth.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,109,0,You,That never happened.,1,wifeAttitude,highLoss,,,,,,,,[Lie,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,109,1,Wife,What? You know it happened* why would you say that?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,109,2,You,I think you’re making things up to try to take my kids from me and I’m not going to let that happen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,109,3,Lawyer,Without definitive proof* we can’t act on this information* I’m sorry WifeName.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,109,4,Description,WifeName looks at me with an incredible amount of hurt in her eyes* but I find it hard to feel bad about it. I’m just doing what I need to do to keep my kids.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,109,5,Lawyer,PlayerName* do you have any examples of times that you believe prove that WifeName is an unfit parent.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,109,6,Description,I don’t have anything specific in mind* but that doesn’t mean I can’t come up with something.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,110,0,You,I haven’t got anything. WifeName loves our kids very much and she always does best by them.,1,wifeAttitude,midGain,,,,,,,,[Admit that she’s a fit parent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,110,1,Lawyer,Well that certainly makes things easier.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,110,2,You,How so?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,110,3,Lawyer,Well I can’t make any guarantees until a judge has looked over the transcript of this hearing* but it seems likely that neither of you will be found to be unfit parents and it’ll probably become a split custody.,,,,,,,,,,,,NeitherParentUnfit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,110,4,You,Oh* I didn’t realise that’s how it works.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,110,5,Lawyer,Yes* under State Law a child has the right to interactions with both of their parents if neither are found to be unfit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,110,6,Wife,Even if the parents don’t want the other to be involved?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,110,7,Lawyer,That is correct.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,110,8,You,I guess we’re both going to be in the kids’ lives then.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,110,9,Lawyer,For now. Keep in mind that this case is still going* so if either of you prove yourself to be an unfit parent before this case has concluded that could very quickly change.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,110,10,Description,WifeName looks over at me* as if to tell me that she’ll be watching my every move.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,110,11,Wife,Thank you for your time HotDivorceLawyerName.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,110,12,You,Yes* we appreciate what you’ve done so far.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,110,13,Lawyer,No worries* we’ll pick this up next week.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,111,0,You,I mean* where do I even start. How about the time she left out the knives and KidGirlName accidentally cut herself?,1,wifeAttitude,highLoss,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,111,1,Wife,Excuse me?! That never happened!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,111,2,You,You probably just forgot* you were pretty drunk.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,111,3,Description,WifeName turns to HotDivorceLawyerName.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,111,4,Wife,This is insane. He can’t just throw accusations like that at me with no proof!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,111,5,Lawyer,You’re right. Do you have proof* PlayerName?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,111,6,You,Uh* well no. I didn’t record it or anything.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,111,7,Lawyer,Then as we stand currently* neither of you are provably unfit parents. Going into future hearings* this will most likely be treated as a split custody case.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,111,8,You,What* why’s that?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,111,9,Lawyer,Well* under State Law* a child has the right to interactions with both of their parents if neither are found to be unfit.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,111,10,Wife,Even if the parents don’t want the other to be involved?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,111,11,Lawyer,Yes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,111,12,Description,WifeName glares at me. Probably shouldn’t have lied that like without checking if it’d work first.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,111,13,Lawyer,That’s all the time we have for today* so let’s pick this up next week.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,111,14,You,Great* thank you for your time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,111,15,Wife,Yes. Thanks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,111,16,Description,WifeName’s eyes remain laser focused on me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,112,0,Lawyer,I believe you wish to split custody of the children* is that correct?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Action,WantsSplitCustody,TRUE,,,,,,,,,
12,27,112,1,You,It is.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,112,2,Wife,Yes* that’s right.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,112,3,Lawyer,Brilliant* then we can get started on the scheduling. Now* as far as I am aware* the two of you still live together* yes?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,112,4,Wife,Currently.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,112,5,Lawyer,In order for split custody to apply* the two of you would have to live at different residences. Is that something that is planned for the future?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,112,6,Wife,Uh… it’s not something we’ve discussed yet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,112,7,Lawyer,What about you PlayerName?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,113,0,You,Oh absolutely. The sooner the better.,2,wifeAttitude,midLoss,lawyerAttitude,midGain,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,113,1,Wife,That’s a bit rude.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,113,2,You,No offense. I just mean it’ll be best for both of us once we have our own places.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,113,3,Wife,Maybe* but now isn’t the time to talk about it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,113,4,You,I just think-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,113,5,Wife,Not now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,113,6,You,… Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,113,7,Description,WifeName and I shoot daggers at each other for a second before HotDivorceLawyerName speaks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,113,8,Lawyer,We can get back to living arrangements later. For now* let’s look at the schedule.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,113,9,Description,HotDivorceLawyerName starts listing common split custody arrangements. I don’t pay much attention* the words kind of just washing over me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,113,10,Lawyer,Okay* so I’ll leave those with you* you guys can think over them and we can pick this back up next week.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,113,11,Description,HotDivorceLawyerName hands a stack of papers over to WifeName.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,113,12,Wife,Great* thank you very much.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,113,13,Description,I snap back into the conversation* realising that I should probably say something on the way out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,114,0,You,I mean* I’d prefer it didn’t come to that. I think the best-case scenario is that we manage to stay civil so the kids don’t have to deal with moving all the time.,1,wifeAttitude,highGain,,,,,,,,[As a last resort,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,114,1,Description,WifeName looks at me curiously.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,114,2,Wife,Really?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,114,3,You,Yeah* really. If possible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,114,4,Wife,That’s… sweet.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,114,5,Description,HotDivorceLawyerName has a look on her face that says she’s heard the same sentiment many times before* and it never worked out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,114,6,Lawyer,Well if that’s the current plan then we don’t have much to say here. I’ll give you some reading to do so that you guys are prepared in the event that that plan changes* but for now I’d say we can finish up early.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,114,7,Wife,Great!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,114,8,Description,WifeName is wearing a huge grin as she thanks HotDivorceLawyerName for her time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,114,9,Lawyer,I’ll see you both next week.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,115,0,Lawyer,According to my notes* PlayerName* you wish to give full custody of the children to WifeName* correct?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Action,WantsNoCustody,TRUE,,,,,,,,,
12,27,115,1,You,Um* yes. That is correct.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,115,2,Wife,So* there’s not really any point being here* right?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,115,3,Lawyer,In terms of child custody* yes. I can finalise some paperwork by next week. Once it’s signed* that’ll be sorted.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,115,4,Wife, So I guess we’ll see you next week.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,115,5,Lawyer,Not exactly. There is another manner of custody that we’ve got to go over.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,115,6,You,What’s that?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,115,7,Lawyer,The dog.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,115,8,Description,WifeName and I are instantly alert.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,115,9,Wife,Well* the kids would just be heartbroken if they lost DogName.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,115,10,You,You’ve already got the kids* it only seems fair that I get DogName.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,115,11,Wife,That was your choice.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,115,12,Lawyer,Can I get a final answer?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,27,115,13,Wife,I want DogName.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

13,30,128,0,You,Guess you just don’t have what it takes. You know* poker is a game that requires a little bit of brain power. Not worth playing it if you’re unable to comprehend any thoughts greater than two words long.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

13,31,140,7,Description,The kids both nod* no longer quite as excited about the park as they used to be. I take the kids home in silence* not sure what I could say to make this any better. WifeName looks up in surprise when we walk through the door.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13,31,140,8,Wife,Back so soon?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13,31,140,9,You,Yeah* there was a slight hiccup.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13,31,140,10,Description,The kids burst into tears* telling their mother about DogName’s unfortunate demise in a hail of broken sentences and sobs. I slip out of the room and collapse onto the couch* letting out a breath I didn’t even realise I was holding.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

13,31,141,3,Description,I watch her walk away* every step like a punch to the gut. When she finally fades from view* I turn my attention back to the kids. The sight of them having such a fun time almost makes me think I’ve made the right choice.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13,31,141,4,Boy,Dad* come join us!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13,31,141,5,Description,I consider waving them off* but who could say no to such a tiny person. I head over and spend the next couple of hours pushing them on the swings and racing them across the monkey bars. Eventually* all three of us are exhausted.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13,31,141,6,You,You guys ready to head home? It’s almost dinner time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

13,31,142,2,Description,HotDivorceLawyerName and I spend the next hours chatting as we walk her dog around the park. Time truly does fly when you’re having fun* and before we know it it’s already getting dark.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

13,32,144,2,Wife,I just don’t want to give the kids too much hope. The quicker we admit that it can’t last forever* the quicker we’ll be able to move on with our lives.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

13,32,144,4,You,Well* why should I be the one to move out? Why can’t you?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13,32,144,5,Wife,All I’m doing is asking. If you don’t agree to it* then we can talk to HotDivorceLawyerName about it next week. But if you were willing to do this for me* it’d make this whole process so much easier.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

13,32,145,2,Wife,See* that’s exactly my point. If we can’t make it work with each other* it isn’t working. No matter how happy you’re making everyone else.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13,32,145,3,You,Well then why don’t you move out? If you’re the one that’s unhappy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13,32,145,4,Wife,If you want to take this to HotDivorceLawyerName next week* then we can do that. I just thought I’d ask.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
