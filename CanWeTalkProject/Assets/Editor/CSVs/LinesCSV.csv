0,1,6,Wife,You’re right. Would you be able to tell them? I don’t think I have the strength to look them in the eyes right now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3,7,17,You,All that matters is that the kids are okay through all of this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,7,18,Wife,You’re right. We can discuss the other stuff later.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,7,19,Description,The two of us head to bed. It feels weird* sleeping there beside someone who just asked for a divorce* but at least it’s better than sleeping on the couch. I finally manage to drift off* dreading the day that I’m about to wake up to.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5,9,7,You,No! No* I mean* emotionally maybe?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,9,8,Description,Every word that comes out of my mouth seems to be the wrong one. No matter how hard I try* I just keep making things worse. Eventually* I decide to cut my losses.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,9,9,You,We can talk more in the morning. You guys need to get some sleep* you’ve got school tomorrow.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5,9,11,Description,The kids refuse to give me a hug goodnight* and I head to the bedroom* totally defeated.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,9,12,Wife,How’d it go?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,9,13,Description,I ignore WifeName completely* climbing into bed fully clothed and pretending to fall asleep. I spend the entire night coming up with ways to try to win the kids back* eventually falling asleep to dreams of a week-long Christmas and fortnightly trips to Disneyland.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,10,0,You,… Yep. You guys did it.,2,kidsAttitude,-10,youAttitude,-5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,10,1,Description,I’m not sure why I said that* but I’ve got to stick with it now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

6,10,5,Boy,Are we going to get put up for adoption?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

18,16,7,You,Hey kids. How was your day?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,16,8,Description,They both ignore me* walking straight to their rooms. I can’t exactly blame them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,16,9,Wife,You’re sleeping on the couch tonight.,1,youAttitude,-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,16,10,You,That doesn’t seem necessary.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,16,11,Wife,You know what? You’re right. What’s necessary is that you sleep on the couch every night from now on.,1,youAttitude,-20,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,16,12,You,I-,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,16,13,Description,I try to respond but WifeName immediately leaves the room. Looks like I’ll be sleeping on the couch for the foreseeable future.,,,,,,,,,,SleepingOnCouch,,,,,,,,,,
19,16,0,Description,I find home to find WifeName and the kids eating dinner.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Action,PickingKidsUp,FALSE,,,
19,16,1,You,Hey gang* what are we having tonight?,1,wifeAttitude,-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19,16,2,Wife,You can make yourself a sandwich if you like.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19,16,3,You,Oh* okay. I can do that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19,16,4,Description,I head into the kitchen to make a sandwich. I know better than to return to the table* instead choosing to eat my sandwich on the bed. A little while later* WifeName enters the room.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19,16,5,Wife,I think you should sleep on the couch.,1,youAttitude,-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19,16,6,You,Look I’m sorry I couldn’t pick up the kids* but I really did have some work to catch up on.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19,16,7,Wife,I understand. But if you’re not willing to make that sacrifice for the family then I think you should make another one. Sleeping on the couch is a great start.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19,17,0,You,Um… okay* yeah. You’re right* us sleeping in the same bed isn’t working. I’ll move my stuff.,2,wifeAttitude,15,youAttitude,-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19,17,1,Wife,Thank you. I think this will help us both.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19,17,2,You,Sure.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19,17,3,Description,I quickly grab my pillow and make my way down to the couch. I’ve slept here before* but it feels significantly less comfortable than I remember. I try my best to find a decent sleeping position* but no matter what* I think I’m going to be waking up with a sore neck tomorrow.,,,,,,,,,,SleepingOnCouch,,,,,,,,,,
20,18,0,You,That’s not happening.,2,wifeAttitude,-10,youAttitude,10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20,18,1,Wife,Excuse me?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20,18,2,You,You heard me. This is my bed* I’m not leaving it just because you want me to.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20,18,3,Description,WifeName lets out something that sounds like a mix between a frustrated sigh and the shriek of a banshee before grabbing her pillow.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20,18,4,Wife,Fine* but I’m not staying here with you. I’ll sleep on the couch.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20,18,5,You,Whatever! Do what you want.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20,18,6,Description,WifeName storms out of the room. I drop into bed* finally able to stretch out* and have the best sleep that I’ve had in a while.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
21,18,0,Description,Family breakfast is quiet as ever when I get a call on my phone. I look down to see none other than the name of my best friend* FriendName. I quickly excuse myself from the table and answer the call.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
21,18,1,Friend,PlayerName! How’re you doing you piece of garbage!,1,youAttitude,10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
21,18,2,You,FriendName! Worse now that I’m hearing your voice!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
21,18,3,Description,FriendName laughs* but his voice quickly drops.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
21,18,4,Friend,I heard about the… you know what. Are you doing okay?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
21,19,0,You,Yeah I’m doing okay. It’s a bit tough but I’m getting through it.,1,friendAttitude,10,,,,,,,,Attitude,youAttitude,GreaterThan,50,,,,,,
21,19,3,Friend,I’m glad to hear that man. You know that no matter what* I’m here for you* right?,1,youAttitude,10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
21,19,5,You,Yeah of course I know that. Thanks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
21,19,6,Friend,Any time. I’ll see you soon. Poker night is still on right?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
21,19,7,You,Absolutely* no way that gets cancelled.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
21,19,8,Friend,Awesome! I’ll see you Friday.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
21,19,9,You,See you then.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
21,19,10,Description,I’m really lucky to have a friend like FriendName. I head back to breakfast with a smile on my face* ready to take on the rest of the day.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
22,19,0,Friend,Come on man* I know you. You don’t have to lie to me.,1,friendAttitude,-10,,,,,,,,Attitude,youAttitude,LessThan,50,,,,,,
22,19,1,You,Really* I’m fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
22,19,2,Friend,Okay then.,1,youAttitude,-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
22,19,3,Description,I can tell in his voice that he doesn’t believe me* and honestly* neither do I. This has been really tough and I’m not sure how much longer I can take it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
22,19,4,You,I’ll talk to you later* okay? We’ve still got poker night on Friday.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
22,19,5,Friend,Yeah okay* cool. See you then.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
22,19,6,Description,He hangs up* leaving me feeling even worse than I did before. I head back to breakfast* getting through it as quick as I can and heading out to do something to take my mind off of it all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
23,20,0,You,Honestly* I’m not doing so well.,1,friendAttitude,10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
23,20,1,Friend,I’m sorry to hear that. What’s going on?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
23,20,2,Description,I spend the next couple of minutes explaining everything to FriendName. He’s a good listener* and I appreciate the fact that he’s here for me. By the end* I almost feel a little better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
23,20,3,Friend,That’s terrible. Is there anything I can do?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
23,20,4,You,Just make sure you come to poker night this Friday. I really need the distraction.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
23,20,5,Friend,You got it PlayerName. I hope you’re ready to lose all your money.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
23,20,6,You,That’s not quite how I remember last week going.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
23,20,7,Friend,You got lucky! That won’t happen again.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
23,20,8,You,Whatever you say. See you Friday.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
23,20,9,Friend,Bye!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
23,20,10,Description,I hang up and take a breath. I’m glad I opened up to FriendName about all of this* I’m sure I’ll need his support in the future. For now* I just head back to the table and finish breakfast with the family.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
24,20,0,Description,WifeName sends the kids to bed early tonight* which I take as not a good sign.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
24,20,1,Wife,There’s something I need to talk to you about.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
24,20,2,Description,My mind is racing. What’s next? Surely she isn’t going to ask me to cancel poker night.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
24,20,3,Wife,I’ve contacted the court and we have a hearing set for tomorrow afternoon. It’s really important that you come so we can get started on the divorce proceedings.,1,youAttitude,10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
24,20,4,Description,That’s worse.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
24,20,5,You,Yeah* sure. I’ll be there.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
24,20,6,Description,WifeName nods.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
24,20,7,Wife,Good.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
24,20,8,You,So* what sort of stuff are we going to go over at this hearing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
24,20,9,Wife,Oh you know. The usual stuff. Division of assets* nullification of the marriage. Child custody.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
24,20,10,Description,She tries to slip the last one in casually but it doesn’t work.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
24,20,11,You,Child custody? Are you going to try to take the kids?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
24,20,12,Wife,What* no* of course not. It’s just something we need to discuss.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
24,21,0,You,Right* sorry. I shouldn’t have freaked out there* of course we’re going to share the kids.,2,wifeAttitude,10,kidsAttitude,10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
24,21,1,Wife,Exactly. I’m glad you feel that way.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
24,21,2,You,Of course. These kids need both of their parents in their life. Fighting each other for them will only make things worse.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
24,21,3,Description,WifeName gives me a hug* evidently relieved that the conversation didn’t turn into a huge fight.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
24,21,4,Wife,I’m so happy that we’re on the same page about this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
24,21,5,You,Yeah* me too.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
24,21,6,Description,With that* the two of us head off to our respective sleeping arrangements. I’m not looking forward to the hearing tomorrow* but it seems like at least we’ll be in agreement of at least one thing.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
25,22,0,You,Actually… I think you should.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
25,22,1,Wife,What?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
25,22,2,You,Well* initially it seemed weird* but after thinking about it for a second* I think you should. You’re way better with the kids than I am* and honestly* I’m not sure how much I can provide for them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
25,22,3,Wife,Are you sure?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
25,22,4,You,I think so. All that movement* half a week here and half a week there* that’s no life for a kid. When all this is done* I think they should live with you.,2,wifeAttitude,20,kidsAttitude,-20,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
25,22,5,Wife,If that’s what you want* then okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
25,22,6,Description,I nod. The kids aren’t going to like this* I’m sure to them it’ll seem like I’m abandoning them. Tomorrow’s hearing is going to be hard* but in the end it’s for the best.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26,23,0,You,I don’t think so. Those kids are my life* and once all this is done* they’re living with me.,2,wifeAttitude,-20,kidsAttitude,20,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26,23,1,Wife,PlayerName* there’s no need to do this. We can share custody. The kids need us both in their lives.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26,23,2,You,You’re welcome to fight* but I’m filing for sole custody. See you in court.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26,23,3,Description,With that I walk out of the room and get ready to sleep. At least with our new sleeping arrangements* I no longer have to worry about seeing her for the rest of the night.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27,23,0,Description,I enter the courtroom to find WifeName waiting there* alongside a judge* and one of the most stunning people I’ve ever seen. The vision of perfection steps towards me and holds out a hand.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
